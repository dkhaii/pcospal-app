## Problem Background
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a collection of symptoms resulting from a disorder in the endocrine system and this condition is usually seen in many women of childbearing age. 
The study indicates that up to 15% of the female population worldwide has been affected by this syndrome (`Pittonen et al, 2021`).
Women who experienced this syndrome may experience infertility, impaired glucose tolerance, depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), increased risk of endometrial cancer and liver disease, diabetes, weight problems, and also possible to give birth to premature babies. 
Many women, particularly in Indonesia, are unaware and they often ignore that they have symptoms or risk factors that increase their likelihood of experiencing PCOS. 
If not treated seriously, it can be lead to serious health problems even can have fatal consequences leading to death. 
Although PCOS cannot be completely cured, its symptoms can be controlled and managed with the right treatment and a healthy lifestyle. **We chose this case because we want to help reduce the women's mortality rate from disease.**

## Solution
Through this project, we tried to make an application that can classify the risk of someone getting PCOS based on their conditions and symptoms.
We implemented a built-in AI technology offering a prediction and asesses user potential risk of PCOS and provides personalized tips to safeguard their health.
PCOS Pal is a groundbreaking app designed exclusively for women. We want to empower women with knowledge about PCOS and want to help prevent them from getting PCOS.

## App Demo

## Future Development
Our application is not completely finished and we are still trying to develop it. We hope to develop this app further such as improving the model so that it can provide more accurate predictions, adding more useful features etc. Thus, we hope that our project can actually be implemented and released so that people can feel the benefits.
